Given a fixed sequence S_1 ... S_N we define q(i,j) the energy to
split S_i ... S_{j-1}. We have q(i,j) = min_k q(i,k)+q(k,j) with
q(i,i)=q(i,i+1)=0


There are less than N² situations (N possibles values for i and for j)
and N transitions for each so overall complexity is N³.

Beware of the types! You need to use 64 bits integers!
