Let us modify the problem and allow shooting a single
asteroid. Clearly any optimal strategy in this new problem corresponds
to an optimal strategy in the original problem.

Now, consider the graph G where nodes are either (C) columns, (R) rows
or one the two special nodes (S) and (T). In this graph there is also
an edge from (S) to all (C), an edge from each (R) to (T) and an edge
between the c-th column to the r-th row when there is an asteroid in
(r,c). We claim that a S-T-cut in this graph is strategy to destroy
all asteroids. Indeed we associate S-C-edges, resp. R-T-edges, with
shooting the corresponding column, resp. row. For R-C-edges we
associate them with shooting the corresponding asteroid.

Clearly if we have a strategy to shoot all asteroid, it corresponds
to a cut in this graph and what we want is a minimal cut. By
max-flow=min-cut we just need to find a max-flow in this graph (all
capacities are set to 1).
